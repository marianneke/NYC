# NYC rodent inspection data
Google maps visualization of NYC open dataset containing dates, locations and details on rodent inspections. The data is regularly updated and can be found at:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj

## To do:
1. Create custom markers depending on the type and outcome of inspection (inspection passed, signs of infestation, bait applied, compliance visit)
2. Create a webpage displaying the map
3. Add data on other infestations (cockroaches, bedbugs) to the map
